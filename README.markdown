\BlueLaTeX
==========

The \BlueLaTeX server and web client that allows people to collaboratively write LaTeX documents with real-time synchronization.

<http://www.publications.li/blue> runs \BlueLaTeX.

\BlueLaTeX is free open-source software, which offers you several advantages.
It is still under heavy development but our goals are the following:
 - as a user:
   - you can have your own instance, running on your server, and keep your data at home,
   - it offers you a clear Restful API which allows for interoperability, to integrate the service with your favorite \LaTeX editor,
   - it is designed to be part of a distributed system, so you can scale up by adding more instance
   - you can share it as your want (according to the licence, of course).
 - as a developer:
   - it uses a convergent synchronization protocol based on mobwrite, designed to be easy to distribute,
   - it is implemented in a modular (but not too modular) way, so that you can easily add new features,
   - you can modify it to your need, and integrate it in your own solution (according to the licence, of course).

We are actively looking for contributors, please contact us and send pull requests if you are interested!
