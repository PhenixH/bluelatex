\BlueLaTeX
==========

The \BlueLaTeX server and web client that allows people to collaboratively write LaTeX documents with real-time synchronization.

<http://www.publications.li/blue> runs \BlueLaTeX.

Compared to <http://writelatex.com> or <http://sharelatex.com>, BlueLaTeX is open-source. Consequently, **for privacy**, you can have your own instance of BlueLaTeX running on your server behind a firewall. **For extension**, you can tailor the code to your needs.

We are actively looking for contributors!
